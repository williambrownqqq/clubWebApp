So this is Spring Boot application,

it is running embedded Tomcat and I do have

a simple controller here.

I have two controllers, an IndexController,

returns back the Thymeleaf view of index.

A ProductController that shows some products,

I do have a simple domain class called Product,

using JPA mappings.

Now this is going to be backed by an H2

in memory database and to access data

we are going through Spring Data JPA,

using a CrudRepository and the one secret sauce

here is I have a ProductLoader to on start up

ContextRefreshedEvent looks for that

and we add in a couple of products

so we get some data preloaded in our H2 in memory database.

And we want to see a little Spring Security

so we even have Spring Security set up,

we're using an in memory authentication,

admin ADMIN, user USER.

Trying to remember what I had in the web configuration

so all this sets up for the H2 database console.

And let's see here.

No big deal here we have Thymeleaf templates,

using fragments to do a header

and we have a little product form

where we can actually add stuff into the database.

Everything is running.
